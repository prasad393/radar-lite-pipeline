# Algorithms (Short Notes)

- **FMCW**: mix beat frequency encodes range; successive chirps encode Doppler.
- **FFT**: radix-2 Cooley–Tukey; we use simple complex arrays.
- **CA-CFAR**: average of training cells + scale factor → threshold; compare CUT.
- **Kalman (CV)**: state `[range, vel]` with constant-velocity model; scalar measurement on range.
